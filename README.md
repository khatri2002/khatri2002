## 👋 About Me

I’m a **software developer** with a background in computer science and over two years of professional experience, based in India.

<br/>

During my college years, I started building small projects that gradually grew in complexity and purpose. What began as experimentation turned into discipline, and over time that curiosity evolved into expertise.

Most of my professional experience has been in product focused environments where ownership matters and execution moves fast. I’ve worked across the spectrum, from implementing features to contributing to products from the ground up. I enjoy thinking through architectural decisions and designing systems that are clean, scalable, and reliable.
